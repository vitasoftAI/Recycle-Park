# Recycle-Park

This repository contains a deep learning (DL)-based artificial intelligence (AI) image classification model training to classify different used automobile parts (specifically, Genesis, KIA, and Hyundai). The AI model used for the classification task is RexNet ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00992.pdf) and [code](https://github.com/clovaai/rexnet)). The model can be trained using two different frameworks ([PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/)).
